/**
 * Retrieves and caches rails and information about rails, mapped to
 * the minecart and rail positions. The cache eliminates frequent lookups
 * using more expensive discovery methods. This lookup is of a single Bukkit
 * World.<br>
 * <br>
 * Per section of rail tied to rail block and type, the following information is cached:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Rail block and rail type
 * <li>Signs and their detected sign actions activated by them
 * <li>Minecart Members occupying the section of rails
 * </ul>
 * The cache stores information in memory for so long it is accessed, and the
 * cached information is automatically wiped when no longer used. The data is
 * validated every tick, such as by checking signs exist and the rail type still
 * detects the rail block as a valid rail.<br>
 * <br>
 * This lookup is not multi-thread safe and all access must be done from the main
 * Bukkit thread.<br>
 * <br>
 * It is very important to check {@link #isValid()} regularly, at least every tick, to make
 * sure the lookup is still valid. If it is not valid, it should be refreshed using
 * {@link #refresh()}.
