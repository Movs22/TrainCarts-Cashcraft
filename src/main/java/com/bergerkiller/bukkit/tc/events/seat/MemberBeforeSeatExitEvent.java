/**
 * Event fired when a passenger is about to be removed from a MinecartMember.
 * Similar to the VehicleExitEvent, but more reliable cross-version and
 * filters out just the events for Traincarts carts.<br>
 * <br>
 * Sometimes players exit one seat to enter another one. In that case, a
 * {@link MemberBeforeSeatChangeEvent} is fired instead, which is a sub-class of
 * this event. You can use {@link #isSeatChange()} to check for this.<br>
 * <br>
 * After this event, a vehicle exit event or Paper entity dismount event can
 * also be fired, and cancelled. If actual changes need to be monitored, without the
 * option to cancel the event, listen for {@link MemberSeatExitEvent} instead.
