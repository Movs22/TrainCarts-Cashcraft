/**
 * Event fired after a passenger was removed from a MinecartMember.
 * Similar to the VehicleExitEvent, but more reliable cross-version and
 * filters out just the events for Traincarts carts.<br>
 * <br>
 * Sometimes players exit one seat to enter another one. In that case, a
 * {@link MemberSeatChangeEvent} is fired instead, which is a sub-class of
 * this event. You can use {@link #isSeatChange()} to check for this.<br>
 * <br>
 * This event can not be cancelled and is meant for monitoring seat
 * changes. To cancel seat exiting, handle {@link MemberBeforeSeatExitEvent}
 * instead.<br>
 * <br>
 * During the handling of this event, the exiting has already completed.
 * As such, the entity will not be a passenger of the member vehicle's
 * old seat. If this is a seat change event for the same member, then
 * the entity may still be a passenger of the member.
